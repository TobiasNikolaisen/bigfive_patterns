This project investigates patterns in [Big Five personality traits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Five_personality_traits) across a small sample of fictional characters and historical figures. It uses personality scores generated by the [**Symanto API**](https://rapidapi.com/symanto-symanto-default/api/big-five-personality-insights), which analyzes free-form text to estimate Big Five traits and facets.

The Symanto API estimates Big Five personality traits by analyzing how people express themselves in text. It identifies patterns related to personal viewpoints and ways of thinking.

The project was created as part of the exam in **HEL-8048: Advanced Data Analysis and Visualization Using Programming** Spring 2025 at UiT – The Arctic University of Norway.

## Project Goals

The project explores the following guiding questions:

1. **Do protagonists reflect the personalities of their writers?**  
   Are there consistent similarities in personality trait scores between a writer and the character they created?

2. **Are protagonists psychologically alike?**  
   Do fictional protagonists tend to exhibit a similar personality profile, regardless of who wrote them?

3. **Is the Symanto API a valid tool for this kind of profiling?**  
   We investigate the validity of the Symanto API tool.

## Personality Model

The analysis is based on the [**Big Five** personality traits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Five_personality_traits):
- **Openness** (e.g., imaginative, emotionally aware)
- **Conscientiousness** (e.g., disciplined, orderly)
- **Extraversion** (e.g., assertive, outgoing)
- **Agreeableness** (e.g., trusting, altruistic)
- **Neuroticism** (e.g., prone to worry, emotionally reactive)

Each trait includes six sub-facets, providing more detailed insight into individual differences.

## Installation

To run the analysis on your own machine:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/bigfive_patterns.git
   cd bigfive_patterns
   ```

   Alternatively, you can set up the environment using `conda` and the provided `.yml` file:

   ```bash
   conda env create -f bigfive_patterns.yml
   conda activate bigfive_patterns
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment (optional):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

> **Note:** You do not need to run any data merging scripts. The merged dataset (`merged_output.csv`) is already included in the `data/` folder. You can go ahead and run the notebook directly.

4. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python notebooks/data_analysis.ipynb.py
   ```

## Dependencies

- Python 3.8+
- pandas
- seaborn
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn
- numpy

(Installable via `requirements.txt`)

> **If you're using `conda` and the `bigfive_patterns.yml` file, you do not need to use `requirements.txt`. Both files define the same environment, just in different formats.**
