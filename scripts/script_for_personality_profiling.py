        "text": "Until you make the unconscious conscious, it will direct your life and you will call it fate. I am not what happened to me, I am what I choose to become. Your visions will become clear only when you can look into your own heart. Who looks outside, dreams; who looks inside, awakes."

        "text": "Imagination is a strong, restless faculty, which claims to be heard and exercised: are we to be quite deaf to her cry, and insensate to her struggles? Life appears to me too short to be spent in nursing animosity, or registering wrongs. I can live alone, if self-respect, and circumstances require me so to do."

        "text": "Man is a mystery: if you spend your entire life trying to puzzle it out, then do not say that you have wasted your time. I occupy myself with this mystery, because I want to be a man. I want to say to you, about myself, that I am a child of this age, a child of unfaith and skepticism, and probably (indeed I know it) shall remain so to the end of my life. How dreadfully has it tormented me (and torments me even now) this longing for faith, which is all the stronger for the proofs I have against it."

I do not want people to be very agreeable, as it saves me the trouble of liking them a great deal. Life seems but a quick succession of busy nothings."

        "text": "The first and greatest victory is to conquer yourself; to be conquered by yourself is of all things most shameful and vile. I am the wisest man alive, for I know one thing, and that is that I know nothing. At the touch of love, everyone becomes a poet."

        "text": "We are going to die, and that makes us the lucky ones. Most people are never going to die because they are never going to be born. Faith is the great cop-out, the great excuse to evade the need to think and evaluate evidence. Faith is belief in spite of, even perhaps because of, the lack of evidence."

        "text": "Being entirely honest with oneself is a good exercise. The mind is like an iceberg; it floats with one-seventh of its bulk above water. Words have a magical power. They can either bring the greatest happiness or the deepest despair."

        "text": "If we introduce kids to these ideas at an age-appropriate time, you can get them to think about these issues before they are in a situation where they have to deal with them. I was flipping through images of reality television, where there were these young people competing for a million dollars... and then I saw footage from the Iraq war, and these two things began to fuse together in a very unsettling way."

	"text": "I definitely prefer planning things far ahead as it gives me a sense control and security. However, it can feel like a waste of time if the plans goes sideways early on. I usually make decision based on logic and to the limits of my knowledge. However, when I have insufficient knowledge I have no problem going with my intuition."

How despicably have I acted!... I, who have prided myself on my discernment!... Till this moment I never knew myself."

I knew I could do it this time, because I'd already done it. Does that make sense? Be brave, Professor. Be brave like my mother ... Otherwise, you disgrace her. Otherwise, she died for nothing. Otherwise, the bowl will remain empty ... forever."

It's the honest ones you want to watch out for, because you can never predict when they're going to do something incredibly... stupid. It's not just a keel and a hull and a deck and sails, that's what a ship needs but what a ship is... what the Black Pearl really is... is freedom. The problem is not the problem. The problem is your attitude about the problem."

That Rue was more than a piece in their Games. And so am I. What I need is the dandelion in the spring. The bright yellow that means rebirth instead of destruction. The promise that life can go on, no matter how bad our losses. That it can be good again."

To go wrong in one's own way is better than to go right in someone else's. The man who has a conscience suffers whilst acknowledging his sin. That is his punishmentâ€”as well as prison."
